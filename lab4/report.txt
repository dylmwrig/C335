1) 2 connections are required for UART
2) It allows you to configure the GPIO pins for different functions and configure different peripherals.
3) The baud rate is the agreed frequency which the clocks need to run at in order to communicate.
4) Newlib does not depend on an operating system, whereas printf and other C libraries will. 
5) This is the main way of debugging code written in an embedded environment, because it gives you some output when none is given by the board itself.

I learned about Saleae (which, when we were working on this, gave me issues), I learned about making wired connections for UART. I had an issue for a while where I only initialized one clock, so it took a long time to debug this problem.
