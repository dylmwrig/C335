Lab 3

1) According to the c335 lab manual linked on the assignment page, this board has 128 KB flash and 8 KB RAM. As for the speed, it runs at 24 Mhz.

2) GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output.

4) LD6 and LD7, GPIOE

5) GPIO_Pin, GPIO_Mode, GPIO_Speed, GPIO_OType, and GPIO_PuPd

My main difficulties had to do with getting the LEDs to light in the first place. I didn't realize that you couldn't initialize more than one LED at a time without using that LED_All macro thing, which I think led to nothing lighting up at all for a while. It's pretty frustrating debugging something that's giving no output, because it's impossible to tell what is actually causing the issue. After I got that it was smooth sailing.
