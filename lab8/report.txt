1) We did not have to initialize pins this time because ?????

2) The main difference is that you have to check if you are sending multiple bytes in the regular read function which implies that nunchuk will only send one byte at a time


3) jx and jy correspond to the x and y values of the joystick, ax ay and az correspond to the x y and z values of the accelerometer, and the c and z variables represent the buttons on the nunchuk.

4) The code from f3d_nunchuk_read bitwise ands the data function with 0x03. 0x03 is a hex number which represents 0000 0011. Because you are anding it with this number, you will only be preserving the data of the final two bits.
