EJ and I only really worked until checkpoint one, so we only really did the initialization stuff and a few of the report questions together.

Q1) 12 pins:
    1 Vdd_IO
    2 SCL
    3 SDA
    4 INT2
    5 INT1
    6 C1
    7 GND
    8 Reserved
    9 DRDY
   10 Reserved
   11 Reserved
   12 SETP
   13 SETC
   14 Vdd

A minimum of 2.16 V are required, maximum of 3.6 
The accelerometer is located towards the upper right of the board, it's a little right rectangle just a bit lower down than the middle most usb port.

Q2) As with the gyro, you have to write before you can read with the accelerometer and magnetometer. The lines of code referenced initialize values on the peripherals. For example, the first two arguments to write are the addresses of the device and register respectively. Value is the register which the data will be written to. 

Q3) These lines read in X, Y, and Z data from the buffer and convert/store the values in the "output" array. 

Q4) Tilt compensation is necessary because you cannot necessarily assume that the compass is on a flat, even surface. Because you cannot guarantee this, if you don't handle tilt compensation you might possibly have incorrect calibration. 

Difficulties: Couldn't figure out the compass stuff. I might have if I didn't spend so much time on the visualization. I think the visualization could have been faster if I came up with something simpler (my original idea was simpler than what I ended up doing). Also, my visualization is pretty hacky. I learned about how directions are calculated, I also learned what an accelerometer and magenetometer are.
